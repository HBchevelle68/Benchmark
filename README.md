# Benchmark


* Benchmarking tool to measure program and function execution performance
  - typedefs for commonly used chrono types
  - template functions allow you to pass a a function and its args to measure function execution time
  
* Compiled with Visual C++ 12.0 (Visual Studio 2013)
  - The Visual C++ 14.0 (Visual Studio 2015) changes how <chrono> works. In order to work needs to be compiled on Visual C++ 12.0. I haven't tested with any later versions.
  - I have no plans on keeping this updated since it was just a fun learning project :)

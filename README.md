# Benchmark


* Benchmarking tool to measure program and function performance
  - typedefs for commonly used chrono types
  - template functions allow you to pass a a function and its args to measure function execution time
  
* Compiled with Visual C++ 12.0 (Visual Studio 2013)
  - The Visual C++ 14.0 compiler (Visual Studio 2015) compiles the code differently and thus this header no longer works as intended :(
  - I have no plans on keeping this updated since it was just a fun learning project :)
  
  
### Prerequisites

* Compiled with Visual C++ 12.0 (Visual Studio 2013)
* c++11
